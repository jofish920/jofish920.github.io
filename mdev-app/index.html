  <h1>Josef Meyer's TAFE Mobile Development Project</h1>
  This is a project that I am undertaking as part of a course on
  developing applications for mobile devices.
  One of the requirements for the project is that it makes use of
  some web APIs.
  I am currently considering two small projects:
  <ul>
  <li>
  A book search API that makes use of data from the open library project
  and possibly other free sources to maintain reading lists.
  </li>
  <li>
  A code editor with the capacity to store documents on Google Drive and
  possibly submit code for execution on another site.
  </li>
  </li>
  The second of these would be my preferred option, but for this I need
  to get authentication working, which is the purpose of setting up
  this area for project documentation.
